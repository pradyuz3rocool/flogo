      <description>We think it is awesome that you want to get started with Project Flogo! To get started you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to install anything other than Docker!
In this quickstart guide we&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the prerequisites for getting up and running with your first Flogo app.
Getting Docker To make it easy to get started the Flogo Web UI is packaged up as a docker image which you can get from docker hub.</description>

      <description>Before you get started Before you can get started with the cli tools you need to make sure you the Go programming language installed.
Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to set your GOPATH variable and make sure that $GOPATH/bin is part of your path. (see here or here for more details)
 Installing the cli tools Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve installed the Go programming language there are a few commands you can run to install the cli and make developing with the cli tools even easier</description>

my_app/ flogo.json src/ my_app/ imports.go main.go vendor/  files The most important files are
 flogo.json : flogo project application configuration descriptor file imports.go : contains go imports for contributions (activities, triggers and models) used by the application main.go : main file for the engine.  directories The most important directories are

      <description>First and foremost, Flogo supports inferencing TensorFlow models, it does not support training of models using incoming data. The training should be performed in Python and the protobuf and checkpoints exported for inferencing at runtime in Flogo.
Before you can begin inferencing TensorFlow models within your Flogo Flows, we’ll need to consider a few requirements.
Pre-requisites The TensorFlow dynamic lib must be installed on both your development machine, as well as the target device.</description>

      <description>Before you begin with the ML Inferencing activity, refer to the Flows &amp;gt; TensorFlow &amp;gt; Getting Started documentation.
Overview of the Inferencing Activity The Inferencing activity was built to support the concept of plugable frameworks, however the only supported framework is currently TensorFlow. The activity leverages the Golang API from TensorFlow. You don&amp;rsquo;t need Python or anything other than the TensorFlow dynamic library installed on your target machine.
Inputs model The model input to the activity should be either of the following:</description>

      <guid>https://tibcosoftware.github.io/flogo/development/flows/io-parameters/</guid>
      <description>For Flogo a Flow is more inline with the concept of a function, that is, a Flow has both input and output parameters. The concept of decoupling a trigger from a flow is a key part of supporting multiple triggers and re-use/sharing of a flow. A Flow can now operate against the data that it has defined within its declartion, it otherwords, just like a function, the scope of data that a Flow can operate against must reside within either the Flow context (or as an environment variable).</description>

      <guid>https://tibcosoftware.github.io/flogo/development/flows/iterators/</guid>
      <description>What is an iterator in Flogo? The iterator construct in Flogo enables the iteration of a single activity. The configuration elements are associated with that activity. In Flogo, you can iterate only over a single activity. The iterator acts much like a for loop in any procedural language.
Flow configuration Iterators are associated with an activity. The activity type must be defined as a type 2, which indicates that it is to be iterated over.</description>

      <description>What are mappings? A mapping in a Flogo Flow can be used to assign the value of a variable to that of an input parameters of an activity or to the value of another flow scoped variable.
Types of mappings If you peak under the covers, you&amp;rsquo;ll note that we have a number of different mapping types supported in the Flogo engine. These include:
   Type Description     1 Direct mapping.</description>

      <description>Creating a new activity for Project Flogo is not that hard! Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through the steps required to create a simple activity.
Please make sure that you have installed the flogo tools as described in Getting Started &amp;gt; Flogo CLI.
 The basic framework The easiest way to start creating activities is to have the flogogen CLI create the basic framework for you. The flogogen CLI takes two important parameters to create the framework for activities:</description>

      <description>Depending on where you store the source code and how publicly you want to have the code available you have a few options to continuously testing Flogo activities. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at Jenkins when using a local git server and Travis-CI for activities on GitHub
Intro The project structure we&amp;rsquo;ll use has separate folders for activities and triggers. A sample layout would look like this:
├───&amp;lt;Repo root&amp;gt; │ └───activity | | └───&amp;lt;my-activity&amp;gt; | | |───&amp;lt;all my files&amp;gt; │ └───trigger | └───&amp;lt;my-trigger&amp;gt; | |───&amp;lt;all my files&amp;gt;  A real life repository I created looks like this.</description>

      <description>Unless you want to provide the application configuration (for example: flogo.json) in a different way or format you should not worry about this feature.
We have provided an extension mechanism for you to override the default way of providing the application configuration if needed.
Topics  Default behavior Embedded configuration Custom configuration  Default behavior Out of the box, the default behavior will be as follows:
 Configuration will be passed to the engine in the JSON format Default path for the JSON file will be in the same directory as the application&amp;rsquo;s binary Default name for the JSON file will be &amp;ldquo;flogo.</description>

Using flogo Out of the box, Flogo has the option to build a docker container from the app.
flogo build -e -docker &amp;lt;trigger id&amp;gt;  The above command will build a Flogo app, with embedded configuration (-e), and create a docker image where it can expose the PORT based on which trigger ID you specify.</description>

For this scenario to work you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have access to a Kubernetes environment. If you haven’t set up your own Kubernetes cluster yet, you might want to look at minikube. The team has made an amazing effort to make it super easy to run your own cluster locally with minimal installation effort.</description>
